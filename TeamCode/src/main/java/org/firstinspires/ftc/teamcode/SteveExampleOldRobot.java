PURPOSE:
This code is example code, meant to show a few different concepts.  The code configures the
expansion hub resources in a way that matches the Mr COD robot from 2019.
FUNCTION:
1. Sets up a TeleOp mode that allows for the control of the robot's motion
2. Sets up a state machine that supports basic motion as well as example code for creating driver
      assist functions
3. Shows some of the Java basics, like creating specific classes for different subsystems

    OperState is a enumerated type that is used to define the states in the main OpMode.
    Below, the variable driveOpState will be declared to be of this time and the states will be
    interpreted as follows:
    NORMALDRIVE:  When in this state, the software will give the controller full ability to move
        everything from the chassis motors to the lift/clamp.  This is where the "default" behavior
        of the system is supported.  Based on certain controller actions, the system can be moved
        to other states.
    ROTATEPOSITION: When in this state, the software will "automatically" control the robot,
        rotating it until the robot is facing a specific angle relative to the starting position.

     Due to the way Java handles enum classes, I was not able to get this type to be recognized
     anywhere else in the code--I'm still learning why, but it appears to be due to some gaps in
     the way Java supports inheritance of enums.

        Running most code will take nearly 0 time.  Each sensor you read will take between 3-7 ms.
        Again, that's not much unless you start reading everything every time you go through a loop.
        The faster this loop is, the more responsive your code will be.
        If you start seeing slow response from your robot when you're using it, it's probably
        because it takes too much time to process the code in this loop.

                    the system of having the robot rotate quicker when it's far away from its
                    objective and slower (more precisely) when it's close to the objective.
                    Note:  a minimum power of 0.15 is guaranteed because the motors don't move the
                    robot at a speed less than that.

                    "Closed loop" means that we are determining the next thing we want to do by
                    looking at what the system is currently doing--in this case, I'm picking my
                    motor speed based on how far away the robot is from its destination.
                    Control systems is a whole field of expertise that give you advanced algorithms
                    for doing "closed loop" control.  The most famous of these methods is the PID
                    controller.  This is an advanced method, with simpler varients like PI controllers,
                    that can help you do things more quickly than a simple algorithm like the one I
